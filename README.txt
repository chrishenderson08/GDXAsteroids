Description
-----------
The sole intent of this project was for me to learn a
bit about LibGDX. Implementing the classic Asteroids game
seemed like a good first project. It's a game with simple
mechanics as to not be over-ambitious while at the same time
having enough functionality to be a good learning project.
The architecture of this is not particularly elegant and there
are places where this is blatantly obvious. But again, that
wasn't the intent so I didn't fret too much over architectural
details. At any rate, I worked on this to the point where I checked
off all of the original objectives I had for myself initially. I may 
add stuff here and there but for the most part I'm happy with
this "tutorial" project. I hope the code is helpful/interesting to 
anyone who might be inclined to check it out.


To Run the Game
---------------
Application can be ran by running (simply double-click) the jar file
located in the deploy/ directory. This jar should work on any
system but it was built on Windows 10 so it may not.
